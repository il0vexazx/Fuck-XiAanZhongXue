A tutorial for DIY Xi'an Middle School of Shaanxi Province student ID, which does not have the stored value fearture  
by an ordinary person  
[Simplified Chinese](/README.md)  
[Traditional Chinese](/README-zh_HK.md)  
[English](/README-en_US.md)  

Tell me [how to make? ](/how-to-make.md)  

# What is dis   
A **completely free and open source** homemade  
`Xi'an Middle School of Shaanxi Province`/`Xi'an Middle School of Shaanxi Province International Department`non-resident student card  
It doesn't have any ability to store value (yet)  
Of course, in some people's (Karen's) view **this is a fake card**  

# Is this safe  
Safe but not completely safe  
Someone was **caught** and **get detention(in school)** and **suspended** by using it   
Some people were **expelled**  
My point is: **The factor of insecurity always lies in people**  
If you want use it safely
**Keep your mouth shut**  

# Is this illegal
Although Xi'an Middle School of Shaanxi Province is a government school/government-run School  
But it is essentially managed by the **Education Department of Shaanxi Province**  
Belongs to a **Public－sector organizations/** rather than a **enterprise units**  

> Article 280, paragraph 1 of the *Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China* stipulates: “Forgery, alteration, trading, or theft, snatching, or destruction of official documents,  
certificates, and seals of **state agencies** shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 3 years and criminal detention,  
Control or deprivation of political rights; if the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 3 years but not more than 10 years."

Let's take a look at [People's Congress Network] (http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c2369/200204/d6520607212b434d82843a8c82baac9d.shtml "People's Congress Network") for the definition of state agencies
> "Our country(People's Republic of China)'s **state agencies** include **all levels of state power agencies, administrative agencies, judicial agencies, and military agencies**,  
Persons engaged in official duties in these state organs exercise certain powers and perform certain duties in the state organs,  
they all belong to state officials, and they are commonly referred to as "state officials" in life.  
  
and **public institutions** are not **any kind** of *leadership agencies, military police agencies, or judicial agencies*  
So **does not constitute any crime**  
~~Even if you have not violated any laws and regulations    
But you may still be at the risk of being administratively detained by the Chinese Public Security Bureau of the area~~  

# What's the point of this
Just like other DIY IDs  
This card can forge your identity  
Protect your privacy in some extent  
~~Make your life better (?~~  
the most important is  
If you are someone who **does not like group life in school**/**tired of shitty meals in the school restruant**  
With this card  
You can leave school like your other non-residents classmates at any legit time that school allows non-resident student to leave  
Do whatever you **want** with your homies
Of course, it can also be used to **crime**
Depends on **how you use it**
Just like **a knife can cook but it also can murder other people**
***use it wisely, bitach***

# How to get it
You can make your own DIY ID according to the tutorials and source file that I provided  
You can also send me a [email](email.md) and ask me for one  
Although it is completely free  
But I will not gonna pay for **any package transportation costs**  
**Therefore I strongly recommend you to make your own card**  
you know what Chinese people always say that  
> Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day  
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
